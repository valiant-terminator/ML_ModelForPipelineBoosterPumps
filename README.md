# Machine Learning Model For Pipeline Booster Pumps
- The project's objective is to have predictive maintenance of cross-country Pipeline booster pumps based on machine learning to predict pump failure before it happens. 
  - This enables the business to have less downtime and be fault-ready to reduce the impact of any pump failures on the operations 
  - It can streamline  the maintenance process achieve digital transformation, increase service quality, improve service delivery and contain costs.

- Data & Source Code 
  - Raw source pipeline data having various dependents and independent variables
  - Data Reformatting 
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Normalization
  - ML Algorithm and developed source code
  - Production Deployment and Test Report

- Milestone
  - Gathering data
  - Data pre-processing
  - Data wrangling and handling missing/imbalance data
  - Developing ML Predictive model using train data and analyzing the performance of test data
  - Deployment of ML model.
  - Developed a learning algorithm to find patterns in the training data Evaluation

- Detail of Hardware/Software Required
  - Server with 32 GB RAM and  200 GB Storage 
  - Python 

- Any Other Important Point
  - The time series analysis of the good data retrieved after data wrangling will be carried out.
  - Required machine learning algorithm for predicting the failure with the historical data will be used to develop the ML model. 
  - The model will be built on the latest ML technology using any data science language such as Python or R. The model will be checked with the test data for accuracy.

- Python Tool Interface
